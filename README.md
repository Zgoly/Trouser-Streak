This modpack would not have been possible without you

## Features
- **Airstrike+:** Rains down whatever entities you desire. It used to only rain fireballs, and I also changed the positioning of the spawning. (Credits to Allah-Hack for the original) 
- **AnHero:** Become An Hero! (A quick way back to spawn.) (Credits to etianl :D)
- **AutoCommand:** Automates a list of commands you set in it's options at the push of a button! Credits to [aaaasdfghjkllll](https://github.com/aaaasdfghjkllll). I only added a full auto option because who doesn't love full auto?
- **AutoDisplays:** Automatically spams block displays around all player's heads to blind them or text displays around them for trolling and advertising. Requires operator access. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **AutoDrop:** Drops the stack in your selected slot automatically, or you can choose a slot to dump. You can shift click your inventory items to dump your trash easily. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **AutoLavaCaster:** Simple timer based bot for lavacasting. Aim at the top of the block you want to cast on and activate the module. It places lava, then after an amount of time removes the lava, places the water after a specified delay, removes it after a specified delay, it will build the mountain upward, tower you up and repeat. Position yourself on a block above and diagonally, mostly perpendicular from the targeted block for best results. (Credits to etianl :D)
  - *AutoLavaCaster Notes:*
  - If not choosing the amount of time lava flows for, there are lava timing estimation modes.
  - The `UseLastMountain` timing mode uses your last Mountain to predict the `LavaTimer` and calculates the flow rate if the top of the mountain is a `45degree` angle and the rest is going straight down to the ground.
  - Do not disable `AutoMountain` before done building the mountain you want to cast on, it can break the timing for the above option. Pause by pressing <kbd>Use</kbd> key if you intend to make more stairs on that mountain.
  - The `FortyFiveDegreeStairs` timing mode estimates based on `45degree` stairs down to sealevel(Y63), or down to `Y-60` if you are below `Y64`.
  - The `ChooseBottomY` timing mode estimates time based on `45degree` stairs going down to the Y level you set in the timer options from your position.
  - If you insist upon **not** starting `AutoMountain` paused, you can get the correct timing for the `UseLastLowestBlockfromAutoMountain` in `AutoLavaCaster` by:
    - 1: ENABLE `ResetLowestBlockOnDEACTIVATE` in `AutoLavaCaster` and
    - 2: DISABLE `ResetLowestBlockOnACTIVATE` in `AutoMountain`.	
    - This will return the lowest block placed with `AutoMountain` until `AutoLavacast` is used.
  - You can reset lowestblock after doing the above by enabling and disabling `AutoLavaCaster` or by pressing the button in `AutoMountain` options.
  - The `AutoPosition` option moves you to automatically to a position suitable for casting if you are not on a block. May break caster if you enable it while right at the edge of a block. (Not actually on a block)
  - The `.castertimer` Command tells you how long each cycle has been running for. 
  - The `.lavacalc` command gives you an approximation of how long lava will take to flow from top to bottom across a `45` degree staircase at **20 TPS** (input numbers), or the last Mountain you made from your Y level.
  - Do not use Timer with this module.
  - Rotating your character will break `AutoLavaCaster`. Disable rotate options in Freecam, Killaura, and any others that will rotate you when casting.
  - Fish buckets, and other water buckets with entities do not work. Put the fishy somewhere safe before mountaining.
  - If Build up is enabled, and not holding a block, appropriate blocks are selected from your hotbar automatically from left to right.
  - `AutoReplenish` is recommended if building up, but disable search hotbar option.
  - Do not use Flammable blocks if building up, and firespread is on.
  - Reducing timing options while it's on can break it.
- **AutoMountain:** `AutoMountain` builds stairs in the direction you aim. It builds upward if you are looking toward the horizon or higher, and builds downward if you are looking down. (Credits to etianl :D)(Frostburn donated the framework and idea for the code, credits to them for that. <3)
  - The `MountainMakerBot` option builds stairs from bottom to top, and when it goes u it starts lavacasting on your staircase. Just click and wait for a mountain. Not intended for use in a closed in space (cave).
  - *AutoMountain Controls:* 
  - <kbd>Use</kbd> key (Right Click) starts and pauses mountain building.
  - <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> keys turn Mountain building.
  - <kbd>Forward</kbd> key Turns mountain up, <kbd>Back</kbd> key turns mountain down.
  - <kbd>Jump</kbd> key adjusts spacing of stairs according to the `OnDemandSpacing` value. 
  - Start building, then hold <kbd>Sneak</kbd> key and also hold <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> key as well to build stairs diagonally. Release <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> key first to continue building in the direction you were prior. 
- **AutoScoreboard:** Automates the creation of a custom scoreboard. Useful for advertising on griefed servers. **Requires OP status**. Credits to [aaaasdfghjkllll](https://github.com/aaaasdfghjkllll)
- **AutoStaircase:** Builds stairs upward in the direction you are facing by running forward and jumping. (Credits to etianl for bringing it to life! As well as Credits to Frostburn for writing the original. <3) I just had to fix up some stuff for this one but Frostburn had the base code there. I believe this is the first publicly available automatic staircase builder in a Meteor addon, correct me if I'm wrong maybe I didn't have to learn some Java to do this.
- **AutoTitles:** Displays text (such as advertisements) across the screen of all the individuals who are online on a server at the time. **Requires OP status**. Credits to [ogmur](https://www.youtube.com/@Ogmur) for figuring out these commands, and to etianl for writing a module for it.
- **AutoVclipCommand:** Automatically selects the nearest two block gap going either up or down to vclip into. (Credits to etianl, and credits to the original [AutoVclip](https://github.com/kittenvr/AutoVclip) for minecraft 1.19.2 which inspired me to make this one. :D)
- **BaseFinder:** Automatically detects if a Base or Build could be in a chunk by checking every block in each chunk to see if there are "Un-natural" blocks within them. (Credits to etianl :D, and to Meteor-Rejects for some code from newchunks.)
  - *BaseFinder Notes:*
  - The Blocks Lists have been tuned to reduce any false positives while throwing the maximum amount of "good" results for builds. Adjust if you feel you need to, or add/remove things as needed.
  - The Number of Blocks to Find options is the total amount any of the blocks from one of the lists to find before throwing a base coord.
  - Do not do the same block in more than one list, it will be a waste of CPU time. The torches and signs in by default are fine because they are actually two different blocks, `WALL_TORCH` and just `TORCH`.
  - The `Unnatural Spawner Finder` option locates spawners and if they do not have one of the blocks that spawners have around them in nature (Mossy Cobblestone, Stone Brick Stairs, Cobweb, Nether Brick Fence, and Chain), then flag the spawner as unnatural.
  - `.base` command returns the nearest base to you
  - `.base` `add` or `rmv` will add or remove the location you are in as a base coord, or you can input `X`, `Y` after `add` / `rmv` (ex: `.base add 69 420`)
  - `.base rmv last` will remove the last single base coordinate found. (Good for removing false positives)
  - There are buttons in the options menu to do the same things as the commands listed above.
  - Base location data will be stored in the `BaseChunks` folder, in your Minecraft folder.
- **BetterAutoSign:** Automatically writes signs with the text you specify, and can also apply glow ink or dye. Includes a `Sign Aura` option which rewrites all the signs around to the text of your choosing. Credits to Meteor-Tweaks for `BetterAutoSign`, and to [stever9487](https://github.com/stever9487) for the Sign Aura based off of Meteor Rejects' Chest Aura
- **BetterScaffold:** Give you more options for scaffolding, bigger range and others. (Credits to Meteor-Tweaks)
- **BlockListMineCommand** Adds a custom #mine command to your message history containing all the blocks in the custom blocklist that are near you. Press <kbd>T</kbd> then up arrow, then <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute the command. `BetterChat` module is recommended for infinitely long commands. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **Boom+:** Throws entities or spawns them on the targeted block when you click (Credits to Allah-Hack for the original) I just added more fun things you might want to throw as well as included the option for height based on player Y level.
- **CrashCommand:** Crashes other players out using a nasty particle effect. **Requires OP status**. Credits to [aaaasdfghjkllll](https://github.com/aaaasdfghjkllll)
- **ExplosionAura:** Spawns creepers at your position as you move that explode instantly. Like a bigger, more laggy Nuker module for creative mode. The use of the module Velocity is recommended to avoid being thrown around. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **FlightAntikick:** Moves you down on a tick-based timer. Added in to substitute the lack of a `Normal` mode antikick for velocity flight in Meteor (not a great antikick it's just something). Bind it to the same key as `Flight`. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **GarbageCleanerCommand:** Accessable by typing `.cleanram`. It cleans the RAM of useless junk and may be very handy for improving performance after chunk tracing for a while and can be used to clear other lag. (credits to [ogmur](https://www.youtube.com/@Ogmur) for writing this)
- **HandOfGod:** Runs the `/fill` command on the world around you or around everyone else in different ways as you move around, and as you click. Destroy and modify the world with ease! Operator status required. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **Inventory Dupe (1.17):** Duplicates things in your crafting slots when the module is enabled and the Dupe button is pressed in your inventory. Only works on Minecraft servers on the version 1.17, not any version before or after.(Credit to ItsVen and Da0neDatGotAway for original creation of the dupe, and to B2H990 for making the fabric mod. Credits to etianl for porting to Meteor.)
- **InstaKill:** Shoots arrows and tridents with incredible power and velocity. Enabling multiple buttons causes the amount of packets to add up. (Credits to Saturn5Vfive)
- **InstaMineNuker:** Sends packets to instantly mine the blocks around you until they are gone. There is an option in it to make it only target instamineable blocks such as crops, grass, slimeblocks and more. (Credits to etianl and to Meteor Client, as well as Meteor Rejects for some borrowed code)
- **InstaSafetyBox:** Places a box around you for safety using the hardest blocks available in your hotbar. Also with adjustable range for thic box. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **LavaAura:** Automatically places and picks up lava buckets at an entity's position on a tick delay, or sets the entity on fire using flint and steel or fire charges. Also has the option of placing lavabuckets or fire on every block face which may be useful in creative mode. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **LecternCrash:** Crash 1.18.X vanilla servers and possibly below. (Credits to Coderx-Gamer)
- **NbtEditor:** Requires Creative mode. Generates custom entities in the form of a custom spawn egg, and it can also generate items with custom enchantments and potions with custom effects all based on the settings you configure. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **NewerNewChunks:** `NewChunks` module with new newchunk estimation exploits, and the ability to save chunk data for later! Also with special options for tracing servers that have been updated from a version before the build limit updates, which throw false positives normally. (Credits to Meteor Rejects, and BleachHack from where it was ported, and etianl for updating :D.)
  - *NewerNewChunks Notes:*
  - The `TickExploit` option estimates possible newchunks based on block ticking packets. SOME OF THESE CHUNKS MAY BE OLD. `AdvancedMode` is needed to filter any false positives out. See Special Options notes for usage.
  - The `TickExploit` option can produce false positives if you are hanging around in the same location for a while. It's best to keep moving fast for it to work best.
  - NewerNewChunks stores your `NewChunks` data as text files seperately per server and per dimension in the `NewChunks` folder in your Minecraft folder.
  - Save and Load `ChunkData` options are for the stored files.
  - This enables you to chunk trace multiple different servers and dimensions without mixing `NewChunks` data.
  - If the game crashes, chunk data is saved! No loss in tracing progress.
  - Send chunk data to your friends! Just copy the appropriate folder and send it.
  - There is also an option for deleting chunk data in that particular dimension on the server.
  - The `.newchunkcount` command can tell you how many chunks have been saved in data in the dimension you are in.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ***NewerNewChunks Special Options:***
(These are to be used when the server has two distinct diamond layers, and two distinct lava pool layers underground at spawn.)
- The `AdvancedMode` highlights chunks that have flow only below Y0 as well as chunks that have been detected with the `TickExploit` option. 
- If there is nothing but `FlowBelowY0` chunks and `OldChunks` as well as a few `TickExploit` chunks, then you are updating Old Chunks to the new build limits and those are `OLDCHUNKS`. If the FlowIsBelowY0 are mixed with `NewChunks` and Tick Exploit coloured chunks they are `NEWCHUNKS`.
- When using `AdvancedMode` if the Tick Exploit chunks appear infrequently and are combined with Old Chunks, then the chunks you are in are `OLD`. If there is alot of Tick Exploit chunks appearing and/or they are mixed with `NewChunks` then the chunks are `NEW`.
- `AdvancedMode` can be confusing, do not use if you can't interpret the chunk data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The `IgnoreFlowBelow0` will render as an oldchunk if liquid flow is only below Y zero, and will show as a newchunk if flow is above Y zero, or both above AND below Y zero.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **OPplayerTPmodule:** Uses operator commands to teleport you to each player online one by one at the push of a button, or those players to you one by one. There is a button in the options for it to reset the current player to zero. Thank you to [ogmur](https://www.youtube.com/@Ogmur) for the module suggestion (Credits to etianl for writing :D). **Requires OP status**
- **OPServerKillModule:** Runs a set of operator commands to disable a server and cover up the tracks of the kill command. **Requires OP status** (Credits to etianl :D)
- **RedstoneNuker:** It's just the regular Nuker module from Meteor client, customized for only breaking things that generate redstone signals. Also with included `AutoTool`. To keep you safer when placing lots of TNT. (Credits to Meteor Client for Nuker code, and `AutoTool` code inthere.)
- **ShulkerDupe:** Duplicates the contents of a shulker when pressing `Dupe` or `Dupe All` in the shulker menu. Only works on Vanilla, Forge, and Fabric servers 1.19 and below. Use multiconnect or viafabric (Credits to Allah-Hack, I just brought back the buttons, and make it dupe slot1 as well.)
- **SuperInstaMine:** This `SuperInstaMine` originated from the Meteor Rejects Instamine. I added an option called `Break Modes (Range)` which allows you to break more than one block at a time with `SuperInstaMine`. This option works best against easy-breaking blocks. The option adjusts the positioning and range of the block breaking. (Credits to Meteor Rejects for the original code.) **ORIGINAL INSTAMINE FROM REJECTS CAN SOMETIMES WORK BETTER THAN THIS ONE, download meteor rejects for that!**
- **Teleport:** Sets your position ontop of targeted block, within a possible reach of 64 blocks. Rarely can cause damage, be careful. ***EXPERIMENTAL*** (Credits to etianl :D)
- **TPFly:** It is a purely setPos based flight. `PointAndFly` mode is based off the ClickTP and `AirPlace` code, credits to Meteor for that. ***EXPERIMENTAL, movement is a little weird lol.*** (Credits to etianl :D)
- **TrailMaker:** Leaves blocks behind you in a trail. Has a place delay option to spread placement further apart. Select the blocks you want to use in the block list setting for it to work. (Credits to etianl :D)
- **TrouserBuild:** It can build either horizontally or vertically according to a 5x5 grid centered on the block you are aiming at. Right click to build at the targeted location. (Credits to etianl, and to Banana for the checkboxes and idea. :D)
- **ViewNbtCommand:** Returns the nbt data for the item in your hand in the chat box. There is also a Save option for the command that saves the data to a text file in your `.minecraft` folder in the `SavedNBT` folder.
- **Voider+:** Replaces the world from the top down. (Credits to Allah-Hack) I added a 3x3 voiding script, a TP foward option for deleting strips, as well as options to set max and minimum height for voiding, and instead of just air it can do whatever block you want now too.
- **WorldInfoCommand:** Type `.world` in chat to tell you some info about the server like world border coordinates and other things, and sometimes the players that have played there (players does not work on all servers). (Credits to etianl :D)

## Known Bugs
- **AutoLavaCaster Bugs:**
  - The `UseLastLowestBlockfromAutoMountain` timing mode may not time correctly if `AutoMountain` is turned off before completing the mountain you want to cast on. Pause by pressing <kbd>Use</kbd> key if you intend to make more stairs on that mountain.
  - The timing will break if the server is under **15 TPS**.
  - If you are too far out of reach of the targeted block it breaks.
  - If view of the targeted block is obstructed it breaks.
  - If using `AutoPosition` and only slightly standing on a block (as far off the edge as you can get holdingshift) it will break.
- **AutoMountain Bugs:**
  - Some blocks may cause Automountain to attempt to build while not actually placing anything (Torches, walls, and doors did this until I fixed). If a block does not work please make an issue so I can correct it.
- **More Bugs:**
  - `NewerNewChunks` can rarely boot you from the server when going back and forth through a nether portal. For example, it sometimes may boot you if you just came out of a portal then you re-enter it immediately after exiting.
  - `.newchunkcount` command shows exactly the chunks that are saved in chunk data, so when you are in normal mode or flowbelowY0 mode the returned values are not exactly in correlation to what is rendered on screen.
  - `NewerNewChunks` has to be turned on atleast once prior to running `.newchunkcount` for the counter to work even if you already have data in that world.
  - Joining a server with `HandOfGod` or `Voider` already on causes the module to be turned off due to "Not being OP" even if you are an operator 

## Requirements
- If you are using Minecraft version **1.20.4**, then use the latest **MeteorClient Dev Build of v0.5.6**
- If you are using Minecraft version **1.20.2**, then use **MeteorClient "Full Release" v0.5.5**
- Please try [ViaFabricPlus](https://github.com/FlorianMichael/ViaFabricPlus), which will let you connect to almost any version from a new version client.
- Don't forget to try updating any other mods you are using if your game is crashing.
